# credit_risk_classification
  supervised Machine Learning, Module 20

## Overview of the Analysis
This challenge utilized data related to lending to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers. A logistic regression model was applied to determine if it was a good model for predicting borrowers ending with a healthy loan or risky loan. 

The dataset included information such as: loan size, interest rate, borrower's income, debt to income raio, number of bank accounts, derogatory marks and total debt. The loan status was the information attempting to be predicted.

When looking further at the loan status data, it was broken down with healthy loans and risky loans. There were 75,036 health loans reported and 2,500 risky loans reported. This data is clearly imbalanced.

The dataset was split into Training(75% of total data) and Testing(25% of total data) sets. 

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
